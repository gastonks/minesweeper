# MineSweeper
This project is a basic reproduction of a minesweeper in the terminal.
The main goal of this project is to apply knowledge we acquired.

### Compiltation
First, create the ```bin``` directory and the ```obj``` directory.

```
make stpprj
```

After that, to compile the program do
```
make
```

Finally, to execute the program, run
```
./bin/main [DIMENSION] ([DIMENSION])
```

For example,
```
./bin/main 10
```
will launch the game with a grid of 10x10. Or you can do,
```
./bin/main 10 5
```
that will launch a game with a grid of 5x10.
